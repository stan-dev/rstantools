#' Register functions implemented in C++
#'
#' If you set up your package using `rstan_package_skeleton()` before
#' version `1.2.1` of \pkg{rstantools} it may be necessary for you to call
#' this function yourself in order to pass `R CMD check` in \R
#' `>= 3.4`. If you used `rstan_package_skeleton()` in \pkg{rstantools} version
#' `1.2.1` or later then this has already been done automatically.
#'
#' @export
#' @keywords internal
#' @param name The name of your package as a string.
#' @param path The path to the root directory for your package as a string. If
#'   not specified it is assumed that this is already the current working
#'   directory.
#' @return This function is only called for its side effect of writing the
#'   necessary `init.cpp` file to the package's `src/` directory.
