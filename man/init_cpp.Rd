\usage{
init_cpp(name, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of your package as a string.}

\item{path}{The path to the root directory for your package as a string. If
not specified it is assumed that this is already the current working
directory.}
}
\value{
This function is only called for its side effect of writing the
necessary \code{init.cpp} file to the package's \verb{src/} directory.
}
\description{
If you set up your package using \code{rstan_package_skeleton()} before
version \verb{1.2.1} of \pkg{rstantools} it may be necessary for you to call
this function yourself in order to pass \verb{R CMD check} in \R
\verb{>= 3.4}. If you used \code{rstan_package_skeleton()} in \pkg{rstantools} version
\verb{1.2.1} or later then this has already been done automatically.
