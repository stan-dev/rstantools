Description: Provides various tools for developers of R packages interfacing
    with 'Stan' <https://mc-stan.org>, including functions to set up the required 
    package structure, S3 generics and default methods to unify function naming 
    across 'Stan'-based R packages, and vignettes with recommendations for 
    developers.
