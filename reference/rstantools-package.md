# Tools for Developing R Packages Interfacing with Stan

*Stan Development Team*

The rstantools package provides various tools for developers of R
packages interfacing with Stan (<https://mc-stan.org>), including
functions to set up the required package structure, S3 generic methods
to unify function naming across Stan-based R packages, and vignettes
with guidelines for developers. To get started building a package see
[`rstan_create_package()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/reference/rstan_create_package.md).

- Guidelines and recommendations for developers of R packages
  interfacing with Stan and a demonstration getting a simple package
  working can be found in the vignettes included with rstantools and at
  [mc-stan.org/rstantools/articles](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/articles/).

- After reading the guidelines for developers, if you have trouble
  setting up your package let us know on the the [Stan
  Forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org) or at the rstantools GitHub
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstantools/issues).
