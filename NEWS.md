# rstantools 2.0.0

* Added Martin Lysy as a coauthor.

* New function `rstan_create_package()` (based on
`usethis::create_package()`) replaces `rstan_package_skeleton()`
for the purpose of starting a new package with Stan functionality.

* Stan functionality can be added to an _existing_ package by calling
`use_rstan()` instead of starting a new package from scratch.

* Stan folder infrastructure now puts all `.stan` files in `inst/stan` and all
auto-generated C++ files directly in `src`.  This last step ensures that custom
**Rcpp** source code can coexist with the Stan C++ code.

* Each time a `.stan` file gets added/removed/modified requires a call to
`rstan_config()` in order to generate the Stan C++ code and `Rcpp::loadModule()`
calls.  However, setting `auto_config = TRUE` (the default) in
`rstan_create_package()` ensures `rstan_config()` is called whenever the package
is installed (including via `devtools::load_all()`), so no need to call it
manually unless the user wishes to inspect the Stan C++ code for issues.

* **roxygen2** documentation is now optional, but remains the default.

* Rather than generating Stan "system files" via `cat` commands, **rstantools**
now stores these as template files in `inst/include/sys`, so the build process
can be easily modified as improvements become apparent.


# rstantools 1.5.1

(Github issue/PR numbers in parentheses)

* Fix issue related to changes in the **usethis** package by removing the
`fields` argument to `rstan_package_skeleton()` and setting it internally
instead.
* New generic `nsamples()` (#35)


# rstantools 1.5.0

(Github issue/PR numbers in parentheses)

* New [vignette](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/articles/) walking through the package creation process. (#9) (thanks to Stefan Siegert)

* `rstan_package_skeleton()` now calls `usethis::create_package()` instead of `utils::package.skeleton()`. (#28)

* Update `rstan_package_skeleton()` for latest build process (#19)

* `rstan_package_skeleton()` now does a bit more work for the user to make sure the the NAMESPACE file is correct.

* Simplify instructions in Read-and-delete-me (related to #19).

# rstantools 1.4.0

(Github issue/PR numbers in parentheses)

* Update `rstan_package_skeleton()` to correspond to rstanarm 2.17.2.

# rstantools 1.3.0

(Github issue/PR numbers in parentheses)

* Add `bayes_R2()` generic and default method. (#8)

# rstantools 1.2.1

(Github issue/PR numbers in parentheses)

* Add `init_cpp()` function for generating `src/init.cpp` in order to pass R CMD
check in R 3.4.x. `rstan_package_skeleton()` calls `init_cpp()` internally. (#6)
